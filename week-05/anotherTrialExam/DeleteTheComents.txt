 What the hell does this mean?
using System;

namespace MyFirstApp
{
    class Program  Why can't I just call print() like in Python???
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /* I wish I could use single quotes like in JavaScript :/ */
            string message = "Hello World!!";

             I sure hope that there is a better way to check
